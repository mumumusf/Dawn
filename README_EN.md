### 2Ô∏è‚É£ Register for a CAPTCHA Service

To automatically solve CAPTCHAs, you need to register for a CAPTCHA service:

1. Visit the [2Captcha official website](https://2captcha.com/enterpage) to register an account
2. After registration, deposit funds and obtain an API key (used for automatic CAPTCHA solving)

### 3Ô∏è‚É£ Install Node.js Environment

#### Windows Users:

1. Visit the [Node.js official website](https://nodejs.org/) to download and install the latest LTS version

#### Linux/Mac Users:

1. Install NVM (Node Version Manager)
```bash
curl -o- https://raw.githubusercontent.com/nvm-sh/nvm/v0.40.1/install.sh | bash
```

2. Run one of the following commands based on your shell environment:
```bash
source ~/.bashrc   # If using bash
source ~/.zshrc    # If using zsh
```

3. Install Node.js 22
```bash
nvm install 22
nvm list
```

4. Set Node.js 22 as the default version
```bash
nvm use 22
nvm alias default 22
```

5. Verify the installation

   ```
   - Example:
   ```
   example@gmail.com----yourpassword----127.0.0.1:8080:username:password

   - If you're not using a proxy, you can leave the proxy part empty:
   ```
   example@gmail.com----yourpassword----
   ```

### 5Ô∏è‚É£ Run the Program

```bash
node .
```

When running for the first time, the program will prompt you to configure the CAPTCHA service:
1. Select the CAPTCHA service type (2captcha, antiCaptcha, manual)
2. Enter the corresponding API key
3. Choose the running mode (single account manual input or text file configuration)

### 6Ô∏è‚É£ Using Screen Session Management (Recommended)

When running on a server or VPS, it's recommended to use the Screen session management tool to keep the program running in the background, even if the SSH connection is closed.

#### Install Screen

```bash
# Ubuntu/Debian
sudo apt-get update
sudo apt-get install screen

# CentOS/RHEL
sudo yum install screen
```

#### Create a New Screen Session

```bash
# Create a new session named "dawn"
screen -S dawn
```

#### Run the Program in the Screen Session

```bash
cd Dawn  # Enter the project directory
node .   # Run the program
```

#### Detach from the Screen Session

After running the program, press the key combination `Ctrl+A` and then press `D` to detach from the session and keep the program running in the background.

#### Reconnect to the Screen Session

```bash
# List all sessions
screen -ls

# Reconnect to the session named "dawn"
screen -r dawn
```

#### Terminate the Screen Session

```bash
# Type exit or press Ctrl+D in the session
exit

# Or terminate the session from outside
screen -X -S dawn quit
```
